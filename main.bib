	abstract = {We develop and analyze a new algorithm that computes bases for the null spaces of all powers of a given matrix, as well as its index. The algorithm uses row operations and ``shuffling'' steps in which rows of pairs of matrices are interchanged. In particular, the new algorithm may be viewed as an extension of the classic Gauss-Jordan elimination method for inverting a nonsingular matrix. It is also shown that the Drazin inverse has a simple representation in terms of the output of the algorithm and the original matrix.},

	abstract  = {Given a matrix $A$ over a complex field, an outer inverse of $A$ is defined as a matrix $G$ satisfying the condition $GAG=G$. Many authors like Ben-Israel, Drazin, Manjunatha Prasad, Bapat have discussed the outer inverses with specific column space and row space. Core-EP inverse of a square matrix has been defined and obtained an explicit expression in ({\em {Core--EP} inverse}, Linear and Multilinear Algebra, 2015) as an outer inverse with column space and row space are identical with the column space of $A^d$, where $d$ is the drazin index of $A$. In application aspect an iterative method is an essential tool to find the core-EP inverse of matrices of larger dimension. In this paper, we provide an iterative method to find the core-EP inverse, core-EP generalized inverse for a given matrix $A$ over a complex field.},
